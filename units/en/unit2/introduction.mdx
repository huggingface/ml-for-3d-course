## Multi-view diffusion

Hands on [google colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/dylanebert/ml-for-3d-course-notebooks/blob/main/multi_view_diffusion.ipynb).

The first part of the pipeline.

Not all generative 3D pipelines use this, and it's more related to diffusion than to 3D. And [there's already a course on that](https://huggingface.co/learn/diffusion-course/unit0/1).

In this section, I'll keep it high-level, focusing on tools and ecosystem, so you can set up your own multi-view diffusion demo.
