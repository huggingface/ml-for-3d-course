Welcome to the final capstone project of the course.

To complete the course and receive a certificate, you will create and host your own Generative 3D model and demo.

## Requirements

- **Model**: A model hosted under your username, e.g. `hf.co/{username}/{model_name}`.
  - Ensure there is a [model card](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/model-cards).
  - Tag the model with the `image-to-3d` pipeline tag.
  - Apply the correct license if applicable.
  
- **Space**: A space hosted under your username, e.g. `hf.co/spaces/{username}/{space_name}`.
  - Ensure the space converts images (`.png`, `.jpg`) to 3D (`.glb`, `.obj`, `.ply`, `.splat`).
  - Reference your model URL in the space README.

When completed, fill out this [form](https://forms.gle/rQedXFktHPYeikrt6) to receive your certificate.

## What's expected

This capstone project is very open-ended. You can:

- Build something from scratch.
- Train or fine-tune an existing open-source model.
- Clone and existing open-source model and change the demo experience.
- Directly clone an open-source model and demo.

Check out [3D Arena](https://huggingface.co/spaces/dylanebert/3d-arena) for the latest image-to-3D demos to use as starting points.

Here is an example [model](https://huggingface.co/dylanebert/LGM-full) and [space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/dylanebert/LGM-tiny).

## Step-by-step

If you aren't sure how to get started, the following sections will guide you through the process.

Otherwise, you can start right away. When you're finished, fill out the [form](https://forms.gle/rQedXFktHPYeikrt6) to receive your certificate.
