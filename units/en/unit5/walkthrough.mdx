This section will walk you step-by-step through the easiest way to set up a demo based on [LGM](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ashawkey/LGM), as covered in previous units.

## 1. Duplicate the model

Start by duplicating the [LGM-full](https://huggingface.co/dylanebert/LGM-full) model.

1. Go to the [Repo duplicator](https://huggingface.co/spaces/huggingface-projects/repo_duplicator).
2. Generate a `write token` in your [account settings](https://hf.co/settings/tokens). Copy it into the `token` field.
3. Enter `dylanebert/LGM-full` in the `source_repo` field.
4. Enter `{username}/{model_name}` in the `dst_repo` field, replacing `{username}` with your Hugging Face account username, and `{model_name}` with any name you like, such as `LGM`.
5. Click Submit.

You will see a link labeled "find your repo **here**", which leads to `http://huggingface.co/{username}/{model_name}`.

Congratulations! You can now use this model with Diffusers, and it will appear in [hf.co/models](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=image-to-3d&sort=trending).

## 2. Duplicate the space

Go to the [LGM Tiny](https://huggingface.co/spaces/dylanebert/LGM-tiny) space, which provides a simplified image-to-3D demo.

1. Click the `Duplicate Space` button.
2. Choose free hardware, or ZeroGPU Nvidia A100 if available.
3. Click `Files` in the top right.
4. Click `app.py` to view the demo source code.
5. Click `edit` to change the code.
6. Replace the two instances of `dylanebert/LGM-full` with your model path, e.g. `{username}/{model_name}`.
7. Click `Commit changes`.

Congratulations! You've created a demo and met the minimum requirements for this capstone project.

## So how do I run it?

The demo requires a GPU, so it won't work on free hardware. However, there are many free options:

1. **Run in this notebook**: Validate the code quickly.
2. **Run locally**: Clone your space and run it locally.
3. **Community grant**: Building something cool? Apply for a community GPU grant in your space settings.
4. **Run via API**: Less flexible, but runs on free hardware.
5. **Just don't**: Alternatively, skip all this and go straight to the [form](https://forms.gle/rQedXFktHPYeikrt6).

The following sections will walk you through each of these options.
